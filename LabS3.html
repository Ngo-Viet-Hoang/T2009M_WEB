                Recognising the importance of play is not new: over two
                millennia ago, the Greek philosopher Plato extolled its
                virtues as a means of developing skills for adult life, and ideas
                about play-based learning have been developing since the
                19th century.<br/>

        But we live in changing times, and Whitebread is mindful of a
        worldwide decline in play, pointing out that over half the
        people in the world now live in cities. 'The opportunities for free
        play, which I experienced almost every day of my childhood,
        are becoming increasingly scarce,' he says.
        <li>Outdoor play is
            curtailed by perceptions of risk to do with traffic, as well as
            parents' increased wish to protect their children from being the
            victims of crime, and by the emphasis on 'earlier is better'
            which is leading to greater competition in academic learning
            and schools.</li>
        <li>International bodies like the United Nations and the European
            Union have begun to develop policies concerned with
            children's right to play, and to consider implications for
            leisure facilities and educational programmes. But what they
            often lack is the evidence to base policies on.</li>
        <li>'The type of play we are interested in is child-initiated,
            spontaneous and unpredictable- but, as soon as you ask a
            five-year-old "to play", then you as the researcher have
            intervened,' explains Dr Sara Baker. 'And we want to know
            what the long-term impact of play is. It's a real challenge.'</li>
